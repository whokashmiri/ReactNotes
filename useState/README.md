--props
--props are the properties of the component
In normal HTML 
<input type = "type" placeholder etc> these are properties same like props are the properties of the components
--Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another
-- every components have props
React Gives us Reusability of the components, What if we need to add some more things
to the components- WE PASS THEN AS PROPS
--in Order to use properties we need to handle those properties in the component
    -then we can pass then as props 
    -You can pass a default value of props in the components it will reflect on every instance of that component and you can also pass value to the same prop while using the component




--React provides various in build functions. The order/way of using those functions are hooks- We hook those functions to bring them into Our code-
useState--
---State- Data of a component
--It is used to change the state 
    -- it gives us two things a variable and a function to change the state 
    --variable will hold the initial state 
    -- and the function will help you to change the state
